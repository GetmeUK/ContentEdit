    # A non-editable (static) HTML element.

    # REVIEW: The primary purpose of static elements is to provide a fallback
    # for when a DOM element in an editable region has not been mapped to an
    # editable `ContentEdit.Element` class.
    #
    # To keep the code small we don't preventively override all the various
    # `ContentEdit.Element` methods, but they can't safely be called and as it
    # stands `ContentEdit.Static` elements should not be interacted with.
    #
    # The only interaction currently supported is dropping other elements on to
    # a static element, without support for this interaction static elements
    # could make it impossible to move a static element from the start or end of
    # a region.
    #
    # A known problem with the content of static elements is that we rely on the
    # browser's interpretation of the content (because we use innerHTML), this
    # can lead to differences is the output as well as inconsistencies between
    # browsers.
